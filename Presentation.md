The BCI main functions are sleepscoring and delta wave detection, from these informations it is possible to trigger audio stimulations or any other kind of stimulations.

The whole BCI system is centered around the PC which runs the Matlab code, responsible of signal processing and triggering the stimulations through the Arduino. The Arduino then triggers the TD amplifier which generates a sound.
