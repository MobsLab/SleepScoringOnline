## Lag

### Internal hard drive

We noticed that when recording on the internal drive, Windows periodically ran background tasks that slowed the execution of the script and created lag. To solve that problem, we started to record on external disk drives which seems to be enough to solve that problem.

### Trigger lag

We also noticed a variable lag between the trigger and the effective emission of the sound, this lag seems to be caused by the different elements of the transmission chain. We did not find any solution to this issue, apart from adding two other controls: the signal from the amplifier to the loudspeaker and a microphone in the experiment box. Both were connected to the Intan AnalogIn input.
