## Presentation

As we were developing the BCI, we found it necessary to develop another User Interface which simulates Intan live acquisition from recorded LFP signals, and which performs Sleep Scoring and Delta Detection. It allowed us to test algorithms that we wanted to implement on the BCI, without having to do a recording session. As the Online Simulation Interface also generates Delta detections matrix, we were also able to compare these results with offline detections (check the next chapter to see these comparisons).

Here is how the Interface looks like:

## Getting Started 

The two first things to do are to Load Signals and do the Pre-Processing, with the two Menu buttons on the top-left of the interface.
