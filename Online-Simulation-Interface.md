## Presentation

As we were developing the BCI, we found it necessary to develop another User Interface which simulates Intan live acquisition from recorded LFP signals, and which performs Sleep Scoring and Delta Detection. It allowed us to test algorithms that we wanted to implement on the BCI, without having to do a recording session. As the Online Simulation Interface also generates Delta detections matrix, we were also able to compare these results with offline detections (check the next chapter to see these comparisons).

Here is how the Interface looks like:
