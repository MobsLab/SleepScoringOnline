# Sleep Scoring Online

Sleep Scoring Online is a BCI which allows to score the Sleep state with a close loop. A BCI can then allow the user to adjust parameters, see the current scoring and also set a stimulation in a given state. 

This BCI has been based on the Adrien Bertolo and Baptiste Jouk BCI for Delta wave detection and Stimulation. A Github wiki was also made for this BCI on https://github.com/MobsLab/DeltaFeedBack.

The current BCI has been modified by Mathieu Salzburg.
