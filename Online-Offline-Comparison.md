## Hypnograms Comparison 
To validate our work, we compared the results of the online sleep scoring against sleep scoring results from the **_sleepScoringOBGamma_** function. The latter are considered to be the ground truth. Post processing codes like **_compareHypnograms_** generate metrics and figures that allow us to measure the accuracy of our process such as balanced accuracy, Cohen's Kappa or a confusion matrix.
