## Hypnograms Comparison 

## Delta Detection Comparison 
To validate our work, we compared the results of the online sleep scoring against sleep scoring results from the **_sleepScoringOBGamma_** function. The latter are considered to be the ground truth. Post processing codes such as **_compareHypnograms_** generate metrics and figures that allow us to measure the accuracy of our process.
