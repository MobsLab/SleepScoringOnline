In this wiki, we aim to provide instructions and technical help to the user of the BCI developed by Adrien Bertolo and Baptiste Jouk.
The wiki is divided into two parts:
* Functions: functional knowledge, How-to and practical instructions about the BCI itself and the peripheral programs such as the simulation of the interface and post processing.
* Technicalities: explanations about the technical choices made during the development of the interface and documentation for further improvement and modifications of the interface.
