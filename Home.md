In this wiki, we aim to provide instructions and technical help to the user of the BCI developed by Adrien Bertolo and Baptiste Jouk.
The wiki is divided into two parts:

* Functions: functional knowledge, How-to and practical instructions about the BCI itself and the peripheral programs from processing to post processing functions such as another interface which simulates live acquisition.
We also developed functions to compare online and offline Sleep-Scoring, or online and offline Delta-Detection. We tried to write them in a way that they can easily interact with files in the processed data folder.
 
* Technicalities: explanations about the technical choices made during the development of the interface and documentation for further improvement and modifications of the interface.
